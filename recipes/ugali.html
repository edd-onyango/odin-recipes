            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (if needed) of maize, millet, or sorghum flour (can be mixed with cassava flour)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then pour in some of the maize flour.</li>
                <li>Allow the water to keep boiling for a few minutes, and then begin to turn the mixture with a long wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in more flour and continue mixing. The mixture should start to thicken as you keep stirring and adding more flour.</li>
                <li>Hold the pot with mittens or a cloth to prevent burning your hands, and continue to fold the flour into itself.</li>
                <li>Press the ugali against the wall of the pot with the spoon, then mix it back into the middle of the pot. Repeat this process several times.</li>
                <li>Remove it from the heat. </li>
                <li>When taken out of the pot, the ugali will be shapeless. Use the wet spoon to press the ugali until it is rounded.</li>
                <li>Serve with meat, chicken, fish, or vegetables on the side. </li>
            </ol>
